# Data-science -- Assignment

Welcome to the **Data-science -- Assignment** repository! This repository is part of a series of assignments designed to strengthen skills in various data science techniques, including data analysis, visualization, machine learning, deep learning, and web scraping.

## Contents

This repository includes the following topics and exercises:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, outliers, and data transformation techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights through summary statistics and visualizations.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive and static visualizations using `matplotlib`, `Bokeh`, and `Plotly`.
- **Machine Learning**: Building and evaluating models using popular algorithms in `scikit-learn`.
- **Deep Learning**: Developing neural networks using frameworks like `TensorFlow` or `Keras`.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites using `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy`.
- **Numerical Computations**: Leveraging the power of `numpy` for efficient data manipulation.
- **Data Manipulation**: Working with large datasets using `pandas`.

## Prerequisites

The code in this repository requires the following Python packages:

- `pandas==2.0.3`
- `matplotlib==3.7.5`
- `bokeh`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
- `beautifulsoup4` or `scrapy`

You can install these dependencies using Conda or pip. To install with Conda:

```bash
conda install pandas matplotlib bokeh plotly scikit-learn numpy tensorflow beautifulsoup4
```
